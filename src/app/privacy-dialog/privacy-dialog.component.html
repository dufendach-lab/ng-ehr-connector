  <p>We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals
    Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
    To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
    Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
    That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
    But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
    So what powers cowards to get them to the top
    Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
    The ribbon in the sky is the ribbon that I drop
    Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
    That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
    They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
    Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
    And what's the talking without the match feeling
    That's buried living, And cherry picking
    Every lemon from your berry system
    Then proceed with the pack feeding
    When I was young I had visions of another world
    Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother HurL
    Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
    Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
    I like my pancakes cut in swirls
    Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
    I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
    Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
    Apologize for my weird mix
    What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
    And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
    And smells like shotguns and deer piss
    They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
    First part of a party, that I throw in parts
    One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
    But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
    I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
    From Popular Mechanics to overdosing heart/hard
    Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
    Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
    A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
    Backup the wordplay ain't playing that the man's states
    Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
    And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
    My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
    The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
    That hovers above cities like weather men
    Or maybe weather woman
    Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
    I prefer girls to reign all over the world
    And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance
    Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
    Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
    But Reign like Queens that reign over made man
    And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen
    But Queen like white glove wave hand, and not wave hand, like it's a heat wave
    So you make a fan by waving your hand, I'm talking wave, like you saying, "Hey man!"
    And not hay for horses, and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
    You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
    And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
    And especially when you're recording
    Cause that's the portion that's important
    When I was reporting that I was poor, but now I'm more than (poor)
    It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
    Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
    Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows for my pee pots
    A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
    And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
    And fan out like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
    So the sun rise when the beat drop, and the sun dies when the beat stops...
    Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapse, then it detox
    Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
    Cause he want what we got, like yeah</p>
