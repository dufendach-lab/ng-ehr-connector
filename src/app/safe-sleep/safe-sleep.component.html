    <h3>Place babies on their backs for every sleep</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We recommended placing them in the 'feet to foot' position (their feet at the foot of the cot). Babies should share
    your room for the first 6 months to reduce SID. They should not sleep in your bed with you.</p>
<!--      <br>-->
    <h3>Keep soft bedding out of the sleep area</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Items such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys can all increase the risk of entrapment, suffocation,
      or strangulation.</p>
<!--      <br>-->
    <h3>Make sure each blanket is tucked in securely</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Put your baby with his/her feet at the foot of the crib. Tuck in a thin blanket around the crib mattress,
      only as far as the baby's chest. Alternatively, use infant sleeping bags.</p>
<!--    <br> -->
    <h3>Have a bedtime routine and sick to it</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This will help the babies get into a good settling routine. Coordinate night feeds so if one wakes up,
      you can feed the other at the same time. There's no need to rush to cuddle one baby if they cry. Normally, the other
      twin will sleep through their twin's crying.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>DO NOTS:</h3>
    <p>Do not share a bed with your baby.</p>
    <p>Do not let your babies get too hot when sleeping - keep their heads uncovered.</p>
    <p>Do not co-bed multiples once one or more babies are rolling.</p>
    <p>Do not leave your babies unsupervised on a bed or on a sofa.</p>
